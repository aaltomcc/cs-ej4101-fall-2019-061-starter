## About

I have been studying for a while now in Aalto and I’ve been really interested in software engineering and software development. Before, I have taken some courses related to software engineering, but I have never really learned about agile development or git. I have worked before in a Finnish teleoperator and there I encountered software development processes. That was really interesting, and I really want to learn more.

As I will most probably work in IT industry in my future, it would be very beneficial for me if I had deeper understanding on software development. I’m not really a developer kind of person myself, but I think it is important for me to have at least some sort of knowledge on the field.
