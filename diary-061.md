## This course

I took this course because I want to deepen my knowledge in software development and computer science. I am really interested in computer science, but I have not really studied it as much as I hope I would have. Thus, I wanted to take this opportunity while I am still studying in Aalto. It would be highly important for me to understand software development better and to know how software development processes work. It was also very good for me that the course was an online course as this fall I would not have had time to attend lessons or lectures. I was able to do this course when I had the time, and this suited my schedule.

I expected that I would learn more about DevOps, agile software development and using Git. I have of course heard about DevOps before, but I have not really understood what it means. Thus, I expected that I would learn more about it, what it actually means and what does it consist of. I had a bit experience beforehand on Git as I had used it on some previous course projects, but I think I have not really understood how Git actually works before when I have used it. Hence, I thought I would learn more on how Git really works and what is the core idea. I also thought that I would learn more about cloud technologies and its role on software development, and on how it will develop in the future.
