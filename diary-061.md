## This course

I took this course because I want to deepen my knowledge in software development and computer science. I am really interested in computer science, but I have not really studied it as much as I hope I would have. Thus, I wanted to take this opportunity while I am still studying in Aalto. It would be highly important for me to understand software development better and to know how software development processes work. It was also very good for me that the course was an online course as this fall I would not have had time to attend lessons or lectures. I was able to do this course when I had the time, and this suited my schedule.

I expected that I would learn more about DevOps, agile software development and using Git. I have of course heard about DevOps before, but I have not really understood what it means. Thus, I expected that I would learn more about it, what it actually means and what does it consist of. I had a bit experience beforehand on Git as I had used it on some previous course projects, but I think I have not really understood how Git actually works before when I have used it. Hence, I thought I would learn more on how Git really works and what is the core idea. I also thought that I would learn more about cloud technologies and its role on software development, and on how it will develop in the future. 


## Learned

On this course I learned about CAMS model, the usage of Git and more about software development. I think the two most important things I learned more about were the CAMS model and using Git. The videos were a bit boring, but eventually they had good content. Many of the things on the videos were quite obvious, especially I had taken Software Engineering course before. 

The project was really easy, and I think I did not learn that much about it. I have not used Markdown markup language before, so that was completely new for me. However, if you have any experience on any software development language, it is really easy to use it. It was though quite fun to start use the Markdown language as you could do a lot of different things really easily.

The most challenging thing was getting started with Git while working on with the project. I have used Git begore, but that was quite a long time ago, and thus I did not really remember what I need to do to get started. I had some problems in the beginning as I had already set my email address private, and thus I had difficulties to set up the default repository. The rest was easy after I had the repository set up.

All in all, the course was a nice reminder on software development and agile practices. I think the course could have been even more extensive, for example two or three credits and a bit more content. I did only the starter project, so maybe the advanced project would have been more suitable for me. But I still think that even the starter project should be a bit more difficult.
